Description: This is an add-on package to the monobin package that simplifies its use. It provides shiny-based user interface (UI) that
	    is especially handy for less experienced R users as well as for those who intend to perform quick scanning of numeric risk factors
	    when building credit rating models. The additional functions implemented in monobinShiny that do no exist in monobin package are:
	    descriptive statistics, special case and outliers imputation. The function descriptive statistics is exported and can be
	    used in R sessions independently from the user interface, while special case and outlier imputation functions 
	    are written to be used with shiny UI.
